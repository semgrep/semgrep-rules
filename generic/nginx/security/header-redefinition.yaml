  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    The 'add_header' directive is called in a 'location' block after headers have been set
    at the server block. Calling 'add_header' in the location block will actually overwrite the headers
    defined in the server block, no matter which headers are set.
    To fix this, explicitly set all headers or set all headers in the server block.
