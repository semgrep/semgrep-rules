  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    Conditions for Nginx H2C smuggling identified.
    H2C smuggling allows upgrading HTTP/1.1 connections to lesser-known HTTP/2 over cleartext (h2c) connections
    which can allow a bypass of reverse proxy access controls, and lead to long-lived, unrestricted HTTP
    traffic directly to
    back-end servers.
    To mitigate:
    WebSocket support required: Allow only the value websocket for HTTP/1.1 upgrade headers (e.g., Upgrade:
    websocket).
    WebSocket support not required: Do not forward Upgrade headers.
  paths:
    include:
    - '*.conf'
    - '*.vhost'
    - sites-available/*
    - sites-enabled/*
