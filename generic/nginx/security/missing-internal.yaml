  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    This location block contains a 'proxy_pass' directive but does not contain the 'internal'
    directive. The 'internal' directive restricts access to this location to internal requests.
    Without 'internal', an attacker could use your server for server-side request forgeries (SSRF).
    Include the 'internal' directive in this block to limit exposure.
