    message: >-
      This code contains bidirectional (bidi) characters. While this is useful for support
      of right-to-left languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, it can also be used to trick
      language parsers into executing code in a manner that is different from how it is
      displayed in code editing and review tools.
      If this is not what you were expecting, please review this code in an editor that
      can reveal hidden Unicode characters.
