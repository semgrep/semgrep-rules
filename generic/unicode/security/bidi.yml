  message: >-
    This code contains bidirectional (bidi) characters. While this is useful for support
    of right-to-left languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, it can also be used to trick
    language parsers into executing code in a manner that is different from how it
    is
    displayed in code editing and review tools.
    If this is not what you were expecting, please review this code in an editor that
    can reveal hidden Unicode characters.
