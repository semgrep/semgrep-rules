  message: >-
    A gitleaks generic-api-key was detected which attempts to identify hard-coded credentials. 
    It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code, as this risks secrets being leaked 
    and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. It is recommended to use 
    environment variables to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a 
    secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module). This rule can introduce a lot of false positives, 
    it is not recommended to be used in PR comments.
