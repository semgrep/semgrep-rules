    fix: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    message: >-
      To ensure reproducable and deterministic builds, when performing yarn install, make sure to use the lockfile. Without `--frozen-lockfile`, yarn will update the lockfile rather than using the pinned versions.

      To ensure reproducable and deterministic builds, use `npm ci` rather than `npm install` in scripts. This will use the lockfile rather than updating it.
