    This anchor tag with 'target="_blank"' is missing 'noreferrer'.
    A page opened with 'target="_blank"' can access the window object of the origin page.
    This means it can manipulate the 'window.opener' property, which could redirect the origin page to a malicious URL.
    This is called reverse tabnabbing. To prevent this, include 'rel=noreferrer' on this tag.
