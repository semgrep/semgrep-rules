  severity: WARNING
  message:
    Detected user input flowing into a manually constructed HTML string. You may be accidentally bypassing secure methods
    of rendering HTML by manually constructing HTML and this could create a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could
    let attackers steal sensitive user data. To be sure this is safe, check that the HTML is rendered safely. Otherwise, use
    templates which will safely render HTML instead.
