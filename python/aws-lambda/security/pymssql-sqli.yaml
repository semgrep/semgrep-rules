    Detected SQL statement that is tainted by `event` object. This could lead to SQL injection if the
    variable is user-controlled
    and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection,
    use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead.
    You can use parameterized statements like so:
    `cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = %s', 'active')`
