    Detected the generation of a CSV file using the built-in `csv` module.
    If user data is used to generate the data in this file, it is possible that
    an attacker could inject a formula when the CSV is imported into a spreadsheet
    application that runs an attacker script, which could steal data from the importing
    user or, at worst, install malware on the user's computer. `defusedcsv` is a
    drop-in replacement with the same API that will attempt to mitigate formula
    injection attempts. You can use `defusedcsv` instead of `csv` to safely generate CSVs.
