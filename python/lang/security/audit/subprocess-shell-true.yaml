  message: |
    Found 'subprocess' function '$FUNC' with 'shell=True'. This is dangerous because this call will spawn
    the command using a shell process. Doing so propagates current shell settings and variables, which
    makes it much easier for a malicious actor to execute commands. Use 'shell=False' instead.
