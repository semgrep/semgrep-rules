  message: >-
    The Connection.recv() method automatically unpickles the data it receives, which can be a security risk unless you
    can trust the process which sent the message. Therefore, unless the connection object was produced using Pipe()
    you should only use the recv() and send() methods after performing some sort of authentication. See more dettails:
