  message: 'The Connection.recv() method automatically unpickles the data it receives, which can be a security risk unless
    you can trust the process which sent the message. Therefore, unless the connection object was produced using Pipe() you
    should only use the recv() and send() methods after performing some sort of authentication. See more dettails: https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=security#multiprocessing.connection.Connection'
