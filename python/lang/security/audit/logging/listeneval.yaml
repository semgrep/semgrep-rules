  message: |
    Because portions of the logging configuration are passed through eval(),
    use of this function may open its users to a security risk. While the
    function only binds to a socket on localhost, and so does not accept
    connections from remote machines, there are scenarios where untrusted
    code could be run under the account of the process which calls listen().
