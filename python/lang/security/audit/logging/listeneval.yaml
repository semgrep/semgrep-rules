    Because portions of the logging configuration are passed through eval(), use of this function may
    open its users to a
    security risk.
    While the function only binds to a socket on localhost, and so does not accept connections from remote
    machines,
    there are scenarios where untrusted code could be run under the account of the process which calls
    listen().
    To avoid this happening, use the `verify()` argument to `listen()` to prevent unrecognized configurations.
