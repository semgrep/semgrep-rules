    The HTTPSConnection API has changed frequently with minor releases of Python.
    Ensure you are using the API for your version of Python securely.
    For example, Python 3 versions prior to 3.4.3 will not verify SSL certificates
    by default.
    See https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPSConnection
    for more information.
