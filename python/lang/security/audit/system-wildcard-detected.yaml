  message: |
    Detected use of the wildcard character in a system call that spawns a shell.
    This subjects the wildcard to normal shell expansion, which can have unintended consequences
    if there exist any non-standard file names. Consider a file named '-e sh script.sh' -- this
    will execute a script when 'rsync' is called. See

    for more information.
