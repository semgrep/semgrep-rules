      This expression will evaluate to be ONLY value the of the `else` clause if the
      condition `$EXPRESSION`
      is false. If you meant to do list concatenation, put parentheses around the entire
      concatenation expression, like
      this: `['a', 'b', 'c'] + (['d'] if x else ['e'])`. If this is the intended behavior,
      the expression may be confusing to
      others, and you may wish to add parentheses for readability.
