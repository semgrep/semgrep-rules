  message: >-
    A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code,
    as this risks secrets
    being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. It is recommended to
    use environment variables to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from a secure
    vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
