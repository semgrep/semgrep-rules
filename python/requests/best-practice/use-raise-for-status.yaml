  message: |-
    There's an HTTP request made with requests,
    but the raise_for_status() utility method isn't used.
    This can result in request errors going unnoticed
    and your code behaving in unexpected ways,
    such as if your authorization API returns a 500 error
    while you're only checking for a 401.
