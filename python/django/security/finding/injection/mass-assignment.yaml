  severity: WARNING
  message: |
    Mass assignment detected. This can result in assignment to
    model fields that are unintended and can be exploited by
    an attacker. Instead of using '**request.$W', assign each field you
    want to edit individually to prevent mass assignment. You can read
    more about mass assignment at
    https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Mass_Assignment_Cheat_Sheet.html.
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: $MODEL.objects.create(**request.$W)
        - pattern: |
            $OBJ.update(**request.$W)
            ...
            $OBJ.save()
