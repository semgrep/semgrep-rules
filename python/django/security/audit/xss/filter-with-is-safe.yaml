  message: |
    Detected Django filters flagged with 'is_safe'. 'is_safe' tells Django
    not to apply escaping on the value returned by this filter (although the
    input is escaped). Used improperly, 'is_safe' could expose your application
    to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Ensure this filter does not
    1) add HTML characters, 2) remove characters, or 3) use external data in
    any way. Consider instead removing 'is_safe' and explicitly marking safe
    content with 'mark_safe()'.
