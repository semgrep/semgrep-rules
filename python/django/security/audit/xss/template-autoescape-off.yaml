  message: |
    Detected a template block where autoescaping is explicitly
    disabled with '{% autoescape off %}'. This allows rendering of raw HTML
    in this segment. Turn autoescaping on to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
    If you must do this, consider instead, using `mark_safe` in Python code.
