    The `__html__` method indicates to the Django template engine that the
    value is 'safe' for rendering. This means that normal HTML escaping will
    not be applied to the return value. This exposes your application to
    cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If you need to render raw HTML,
    consider instead using `mark_safe()` which more clearly marks the intent
    to render raw HTML than a class with a magic method.
