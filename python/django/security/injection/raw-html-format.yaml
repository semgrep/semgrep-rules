  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    Detected user input flowing into a manually constructed HTML string. You may be accidentally bypassing secure methods
    of rendering HTML by manually constructing HTML and this could create a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could
    let attackers steal sensitive user data. To be sure this is safe, check that the HTML is rendered safely. Otherwise, use
    templates (`django.shortcuts.render`) which will safely render HTML instead.
