  message: |
    Detected direct use of jinja2 in a Flask route. If not done properly,
    this may bypass HTML escaping which opens up the application to 
    cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Prefer using the Flask
    method 'render_template()' and templates with a '.html' extension
    in order to prevent XSS.
