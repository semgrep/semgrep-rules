  message: |
    Flask response reflects unsanitized user input. This could lead to a
    cross-site scripting vulnerability (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)
    in which an attacker causes arbitrary code to be executed in the user's browser.
    To prevent, please sanitize the user input, e.g. by rendering the response
    in a Jinja2 template (see considerations in https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/security/).
