  message: Detected user input into a generated CSV file using the built-in `csv` module. If user data
    is used to generate the data in this file, it is possible that an attacker could inject a formula
    when the CSV is imported into a spreadsheet application that runs an attacker script, which could
    steal data from the importing user or, at worst, install malware on the user's computer. `defusedcsv`
    is a drop-in replacement with the same API that will attempt to mitigate formula injection attempts.
    You can use `defusedcsv` instead of `csv` to safely generate CSVs.
