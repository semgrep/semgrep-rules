    IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a block cipher created in 1991. 
    It is an optional component of the OpenPGP standard. This cipher is susceptible to attacks when using weak keys. 
    It is recommended that you do not use this cipher for new applications.
    Use a strong symmetric cipher such as EAS instead.
