    message: >-
      Detected an AWS load balancer with an insecure TLS version.
      TLS versions less than 1.2 are considered insecure because they
      can be broken. To fix this, set your `ssl_policy` to
      `"ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2019-08"`, or include a default action
      to redirect to HTTPS.
