  message: >-
    Detected an AWS load balancer with an insecure TLS version.
    TLS versions less than 1.2 are considered insecure because they
    can be broken. To fix this, set your `ssl_policy` to
    `"ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2019-08"`, or include a default action
    to redirect to HTTPS.
