    message: >-
        A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended 
        to store credentials in source-code, as this risks secrets
        being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. 
        It is recommended to use environment variables to 
        securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from 
        a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
