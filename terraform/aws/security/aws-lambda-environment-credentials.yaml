  message: >-
    A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended  to store credentials in source-code,
    as this risks secrets
    being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary.  It is recommended to
    use environment variables to  securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from  a secure
    vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
