    Inspired by https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT.
    DefaultHttpClient is deprecated. Further, it does not support connections
    using TLS1.2, which makes using DefaultHttpClient a security hazard.
    Use SystemDefaultHttpClient instead, which supports TLS1.2.
  severity: WARNING
  languages: [java]
  pattern: new DefaultHttpClient(...);
