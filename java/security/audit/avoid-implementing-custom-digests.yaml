    Inspired by https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#CUSTOM_MESSAGE_DIGEST.
    Cryptographic algorithms are notoriously difficult to get right. By implementing
    a custom message digest, you risk introducing security issues into your program.
    Use one of the many sound message digests already available to you:
    MessageDigest sha256Digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA256");
  severity: WARNING
  languages: [java]
  pattern: |-
    class $CLASS extends MessageDigest {
      ...
    }
