  message: >-
    GCM detected, please check that IV/nonce is not reused, an Initialization
    Vector (IV) is a nonce used to randomize the encryption, so that even if
    multiple messages with identical plaintext are encrypted, the generated
    corresponding ciphertexts are different. Unlike the Key, the IV usually
    does not need to be secret, rather it is important that it is random and
    unique. Certain encryption schemes the IV is exchanged in public as part of
    the ciphertext. Reusing same Initialization Vector with the same Key to
    encrypt multiple plaintext blocks allows an attacker to compare the
    ciphertexts and then, with some assumptions on the content of the
    messages, to gain important information about the data being encrypted.
