  message: |
    It looks like you're using an implementation of XSSRequestWrapper from dzone.
    (https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/07/anti-cross-site-scripting-xss-filter.html)
    The XSS filtering in this code is not secure and can be bypassed by malicious actors.
    It is recommended to use a stack that automatically escapes in your view or templates
    instead of filtering yourself.
