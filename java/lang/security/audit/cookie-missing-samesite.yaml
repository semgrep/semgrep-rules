  message: |
    Detected cookie without the SameSite attribute.
  severity: WARNING
  languages: [java]
  # Java servlets doesn't have support for SameSite yet. It has to be set manually
  # using .setHeader(...). This makes this rule tricky, since we want to detect the
  # absence of SameSite but also reasonably assume they wanted to use a cookie in
  # the method.
  patterns:
  - pattern-not-inside: |
      $RETURNTYPE $METHOD(..., HttpServletResponse $RESP, ...) {
        ...
        $RESP.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "=~/.*SameSite=.*/");
        ...
      }
  - pattern-either:
    - pattern: $RESP.addCookie(...);
    - pattern: $RESP.setHeader("Set-Cookie", ...);
