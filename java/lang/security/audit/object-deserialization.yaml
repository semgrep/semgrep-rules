  message: |
    Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream. Deserializing entire
    Java objects is dangerous because malicious actors can create Java object
    streams with unintended consequences. Ensure that the objects being deserialized
    are not user-controlled. If this must be done, consider using HMACs to sign
    the data stream to make sure it is not tampered with, or consider only
    transmitting object fields and populating a new object.
  severity: WARNING
  languages:
  - java
  pattern: new ObjectInputStream(...);
