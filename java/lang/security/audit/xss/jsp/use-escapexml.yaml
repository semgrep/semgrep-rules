  message: |
    Detected an Expression Language segment that does not escape
    output. This is dangerous because if any data in this expression
    can be controlled externally, it is a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability. Instead, use the 'escapeXml' function from
    the JSTL taglib. See https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/jstl_function_escapexml.htm
    for more information.
