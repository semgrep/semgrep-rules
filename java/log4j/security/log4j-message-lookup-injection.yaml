    message:
      Possible Lookup injection into Log4j messages. Lookups provide a way to add values to the Log4j messages at arbitrary
      places. If the message parameter contains an attacker controlled string, the attacker could inject arbitrary lookups,
      for instance '${java:runtime}'. This could lead to information disclosure or even remote code execution if 'log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups'
      is enabled. This was enabled by default until version 2.15.0.
