  message: |
    Detected a potential path traversal. A malicious actor
    could control the location of this file, to include going backwards
    in the directory with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled
    variables in file paths are sanitized. You may aslso consider using a utility
    method such as org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only
    retrieve the file name from the path.
