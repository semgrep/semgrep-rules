  message: |
    Spring Boot Actuator is fully enabled. This exposes sensitive endpoints such as /actuator/env, /actuator/logfile, /actuator/heapdump and others.
    Unless you have Spring Security enabled or another means to protect these endpoints, this functionality is available without authentication, causing a severe security risk.
