    message: Detected user input controlling a file path. An attacker could control
      the location of this file, to include going backwards in the directory
      with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled variables in file
      paths are sanitized. You may also consider using a utility method such as
      org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only retrieve the file
      name from the path.
