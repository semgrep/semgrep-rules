  message: >-
    Using an arbitrary object ('Object $PARAM') with Java RMI is an insecure deserialization
    vulnerability. This object can be manipulated by a malicious actor allowing them to execute
    code on your system. Instead, use an integer ID to look up your object, or consider alternative
    serialization schemes such as JSON.
  languages:
  - java
  pattern: |
    interface $INTERFACE extends Remote {
      $RETURNTYPE $METHOD(Object $PARAM) throws RemoteException;
    }
