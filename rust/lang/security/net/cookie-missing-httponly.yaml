      A session cookie was detected without setting the 'HttpOnly' flag.
      The 'HttpOnly' flag for cookies instructs the browser to forbid
      client-side scripts from reading the cookie which mitigates XSS
      attacks. Set the 'HttpOnly' flag by setting 'set_http_only' to 'true'
      in the Cookie.
