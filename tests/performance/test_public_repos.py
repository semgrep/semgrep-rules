# This is pure black magic, and I hate it. T_T
# I'm doing this, in short, because I want to parametrize the test functions.
# However, pytest's native parametrization only lets me do the cross product
# of repo x rules.
# So here's why I'm doing this:
## 0) I really want to use pytest-benchmark.
## 1) I need different fixtures for each rule set. With the cross product I have to run every rule on every repo.
##      I also need the repo fixtures so that we don't waste setup and teardown time.
##      pytest does fixtures by introspecting function arguments. Since I'm doing dynamic fixtures,
##      I needed dynamic function argument names. This template lets me do that.
## 2) I need different rule sets for each langauge.
##      I really struggled to get parametrization or fixtures to work this way. All I really wanted was a way
##      to select a subset of the rules based on the setup repo fixture. However, that proved nigh impossible.
##      This is because parametrization happens when the test is collected. There exists an 'indirect' parameter
##      which defers things to runtime, but I needed the ability to decide based on the repo fixture, which
##      needed to be dynamic, which was the same problem as (1).
##      I also tried passing a "table" of records (a bunch of (language, repo, rule_path) tuples) but pytest
##      just exploded when trying to compose fixtures.
## 3) I want this to be configurable from the YAML file so that it's easy to add a new language.
# Seriously, this is my last resort after over a day of wrestling with pytest's behind-the-scenes magic. T_T
