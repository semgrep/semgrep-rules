  message: >-
    In Kubernetes, each pod runs in its own isolated environment with its own 
    set of security policies. However, certain container images may contain 
    `setuid` or `setgid` binaries that could allow an attacker to perform 
    privilege escalation and gain access to sensitive resources. To mitigate 
    this risk, it's recommended to add a `securityContext` to the container in 
    the pod, with the parameter `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `false`. 
    This will prevent the container from running any privileged processes and 
    limit the impact of any potential attacks. 
    By adding a `securityContext` to your Kubernetes pod, you can help to 
    ensure that your containerized applications are more secure and less 
    vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.
