      Found 'x-openai-isConsequential: false' in a state-changing HTTP
      method: $METHOD $PATH. This Action configuration will enable the 'Always
      Allow' option for state-changing HTTP methods, such as POST, PUT, PATCH,
      or DELETE. The risk of a user selecting the 'Always Allow' button is that
      the agent could perform unintended actions on behalf of the user. When
      working with sensitive functionality, it is always best to include a Human
      In The Loop (HITL) type of control. Consider the trade-off between security 
      and user friction and then make a risk-based decision about this function.
