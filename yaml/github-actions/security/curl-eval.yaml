  message: Data is being eval'd from a `curl` command. An attacker with control of the server in the `curl` command could
    inject malicious code into the `eval`, resulting in a system comrpomise. Avoid eval'ing untrusted data if you can. If
    you must do this, consider checking the SHA sum of the content returned by the server to verify its integrity.
