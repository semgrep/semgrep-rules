  severity: WARNING
  message: GitHub Actions provides the **'add-mask'** workflow command to mask sensitive
    data in the workflow logs. If **'add-mask'** is not used or if workflow commands
    have been stopped, sensitive data can leaked into the workflow logs. An attacker
    could simply copy the workflow to another branch and add the following payload
    `echo "::stop-commands::$stopMarker"` to stop workflow command processing ([described
    here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#stopping-and-starting-workflow-commands)),
    which will cause the secret token to be exposed despite the **'add-mask'** usage.
    For more information, please refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#register-a-secret).
