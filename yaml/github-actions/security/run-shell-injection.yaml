  message: 'Using variable interpolation `${{...}}` with `github` context data in a `run:` step could allow an attacker to
    inject their own code into the runner. This would allow them to steal secrets and code. `github` context data can have
    atrbitrary user input and should be treated as untrusted. Instead, use an intermediate environment variable with `env:`
    to store the data and use the enviornment variable in the `run:` script. Be sure to use double-quotes the environment
    variable, like this: "$ENVVAR".'
