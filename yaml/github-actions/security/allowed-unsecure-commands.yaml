    severity: WARNING
    message: >-
      The environment variable `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` grants this workflow permissions
      to use the `set-env` and `add-path` commands. There is a vulnerability in these commands
      that could result in environment variables being modified by an attacker. Depending on the
      use of the environment variable, this could enable an attacker to, at worst,
      modify the system path to run a different command than intended, resulting in arbitrary
      code execution. This could result in stolen code or secrets.
      Don't use `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS`. Instead, use Environment Files. See
      https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#environment-files for
      more information.
