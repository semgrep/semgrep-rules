    message: >-
      An action sourced from a third-party repository on GitHub is not pinned
      to a full length commit SHA. Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA
      is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning
      to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor
      to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision
      for a valid Git object payload.
