      Service '$SERVICE' is running with a writable root filesystem. This may
      allow malicious applications to download and run additional payloads, or
      modify container files. If an application inside a container has to save
      something temporarily consider using a tmpfs. Add 'read_only: true' to this
      service to prevent this.
