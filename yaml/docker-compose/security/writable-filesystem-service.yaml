  message: |
    Service '$SERVICE' is running with a writable root filesystem. This may
    allow malicious applications to download and run additional payloads, or
    modify container files. If an application inside a container has to save
    something temporarily consider using a tmpfs. Add 'read_only: true' to this
    service to prevent this.
