    Data is being piped into `bash` from a `curl` command. An attacker with control of the server
    in the `curl` command could inject malicious code into the pipe, resulting in a
    system comrpomise. Avoid piping untrusted data into `bash` or any other shell if you can.
    If you must do this, consider checking the SHA sum of the content returned by the server to verify its
    integrity.
