    Data is being eval'd from a `curl` command. An attacker with control of the server
    in the `curl` command could inject malicious code into the `eval`, resulting in a
    system comrpomise. Avoid eval'ing untrusted data if you can. If you must do this,
    consider checking the SHA sum of the content returned by the server to verify its
    integrity.
