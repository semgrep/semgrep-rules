      Data is being eval'd from a `curl` command. An attacker with control of
      the server in the `curl` command could inject malicious code into the
      `eval`, resulting in a system comrpomise. Avoid eval'ing untrusted data if
      you can. If you must do this, consider checking the SHA sum of the content
      returned by the server to verify its integrity.
