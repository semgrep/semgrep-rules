  message: >-
    Detected a variable used in an anchor tag with the 'href' attribute. A malicious actor
    may be able to input the 'javascript:' URI, which could cause cross-site scripting (XSS).
    If you are generating a URL to a known host, hardcode the base link (or retrieve it from
    a configuration) and append the path. You may also consider funneling link generation through
    a safe method which sanitizes URLs for the 'javascript:' URI.
