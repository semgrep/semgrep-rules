    message: >-
      By declaring a styled component inside the render method of a react component, you are dynamically creating a new component on every render. This means that React will have to discard and re-calculate that part of the DOM subtree on each subsequent render, instead of just calculating the difference of what changed between them. This leads to performance bottlenecks and unpredictable behavior.
