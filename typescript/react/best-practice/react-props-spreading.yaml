    It is a good practice to avoid spreading for JSX attributes.
    This forces the code to be explicit about which props are given to the component.
    This avoids situations where warnings are caused by invalid HTML props passed to HTML elements,
    and further, it avoids passing unintentional extra props by malicious actors.
    Instead, consider explicitly passing props to the component.
