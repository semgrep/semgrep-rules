    Detected SQL statement that is tainted by `event` object. This could lead to SQL injection if the variable is user-controlled
    and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection,
    used parameterized queries or prepared statements instead.
    You can use parameterized statements like so:
    `DB['select * from items where name = ?', name]`
