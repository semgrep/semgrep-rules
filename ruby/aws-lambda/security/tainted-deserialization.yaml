  message: >-
    Deserialization of a string tainted by `event` object found. Objects in Ruby can be serialized into strings,
    then later loaded from strings. However, uses of `load` can cause remote code execution.
    Loading user input with MARSHAL or CSV can potentially be dangerous. Use JSON in a secure fashion instead.
