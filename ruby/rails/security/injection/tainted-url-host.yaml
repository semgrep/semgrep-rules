  message: >-
    User data flows into the host portion of this manually-constructed URL.
    This could allow an attacker to send data to their own server, potentially
    exposing sensitive data such as cookies or authorization information sent
    with this request. They could also probe internal servers or other resources
    that the server runnig this code can access. (This is called server-side
    request forgery, or SSRF.) Do not allow arbitrary hosts. Use the `ssrf_filter`
    gem and guard the url construction with `SsrfFilter(...)`, or create
    an allowlist for approved hosts.
