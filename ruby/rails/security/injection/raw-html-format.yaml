  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    Detected user input flowing into a manually constructed HTML string. You may be accidentally bypassing
    secure methods
    of rendering HTML by manually constructing HTML and this could create a cross-site scripting vulnerability,
    which could
    let attackers steal sensitive user data. Use the `render template` and make template files which will
    safely render HTML
    instead, or inspect that the HTML is absolutely rendered safely with a function like `sanitize`.
