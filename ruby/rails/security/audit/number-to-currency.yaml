    Detected user input flowing into number_to_currency helper.
    One of the parameters to the helper (unit) is  not escaped correctly and could  lead to XSS, which
    in turn could lead to  sensitive data being exfiltrated. Instead, sanitize
    data before passing it into `number_to_currency` with the
    html_escape (h) function
    or upgrade to Rails 4.0.2 or 3.2.16.
