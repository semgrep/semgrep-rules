  message: >-
    Detected string concatenation with a non-literal variable in a pg
    Ruby SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection if the variable is user-controlled
    and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection,
    used parameterized queries or prepared statements instead.
    You can use parameterized queries like so: `conn.exec_params('SELECT $1 AS a, $2 AS b, $3 AS c', [1,
    2, nil])`
    And you can use prepared statements with `exec_prepared`.
