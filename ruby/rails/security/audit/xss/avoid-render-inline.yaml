  message: |
    'render inline: ...' renders an entire ERB template inline and is dangerous.
    If external data can reach here, this exposes your application
    to server-side template injection (SSTI) or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    Instead, consider using a partial or another safe rendering method.
