    The syntax `<%== ... %>` is an alias for `html_safe`. This means the
    content inside these tags will be rendered as raw HTML. This may expose
    your application to cross-site scripting. If you need raw HTML, prefer
    using the more explicit `html_safe` and be sure to correctly sanitize
    variables using a library such as DOMPurify.
