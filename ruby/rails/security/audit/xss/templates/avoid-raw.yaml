    'raw' renders raw HTML, as the name implies. This means that normal
    HTML escaping is bypassed. If user data can be controlled here, this
    exposes your application to cross-site scripting (XSS). If you need to
    do this, be sure to correctly sanitize the data using a library such as
    DOMPurify.
