  message: |
    Detected a template variable used in a script tag.
    Although template variables are HTML escaped, HTML
    escaping does not always prevent cross-site scripting (XSS)
    attacks when used directly in JavaScript. If you need to do
    this, use `escape_javascript` or its alias, `j`. However, this
    will not protect from XSS in all circumstances; see the references
    for more information. Consider placing this value in the HTML
    portion (outside of a script tag).
