  message: |
    'content_tag' exhibits unintuitive escaping behavior and may accidentally
    expose your application to cross-site scripting. If using Rails 2, only
    attribute values are escaped. If using Rails 3, content and attribute values
    are escaped. Tag and attribute names are never escaped. Because of this,
    it is recommended to use 'html_safe' if you must render raw HTML data.
