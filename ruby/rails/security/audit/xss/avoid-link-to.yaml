  message: >-
    This code includes user input in `link_to`. In Rails 2.x, the body of `link_to` is not escaped.
    This means that user input which reaches the body will be executed when the HTML is rendered.
    Even in other versions, values starting with `javascript:` or `data:` are not escaped.
    It is better to create and use a safer function which checks the body argument.
