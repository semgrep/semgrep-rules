  message: |
    'content_tag()' bypasses HTML escaping for some portion of the content.
    If external data can reach here, this exposes your application
    to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Ensure no external data reaches here.
    If you must do this, create your HTML manually and use 'html_safe'. Ensure no
    external data enters the HTML-safe string!
