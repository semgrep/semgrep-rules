  message: >-
    Detected user input flowing into number_to_currency helper.
    One of the parameters to the helper (unit) is 
    not escaped correctly and could 
    lead to XSS, which in turn could lead to 
    sensitive data being exfiltrated. Instead, sanitize
    data with the 'html_escape' or 'h' function
    before passing it into `number_to_currency`
    or upgrade to Rails 4.0.2 or 3.2.16.
