  message: >-
    Detected user input flowing into number_to_currency helper.
    One of the parameters to the helper (unit) is not escaped correctly and could lead to XSS, which
    in turn could lead to sensitive data being exfiltrated. Instead, sanitize
    data with the 'html_escape' or 'h' function
    before passing it into `number_to_currency`
    or upgrade to Rails 4.0.2 or 3.2.16.
