    message: >-
      Checks for unsafe deserialization. Objects in Ruby can be serialized into strings,
      then later loaded from strings. However, uses of load and object_load can cause remote code execution.
      Loading user input with MARSHAL or CSV can potentially be dangerous. Use JSON in a secure fashion instead.
