  message: |
    Checks for unsafe use of method http_basic_authenticate_with, which is vulnerable to timing attacks as it
    does not use constant-time checking when comparing passwords. Affected Rails versions include:
    5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1, 3.2.22.1. Avoid this function if possible.
