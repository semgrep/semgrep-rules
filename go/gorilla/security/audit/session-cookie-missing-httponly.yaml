  message: |
    A session cookie was detected without setting the 'HttpOnly' flag.
    The 'HttpOnly' flag for cookies instructs the browser to forbid
    client-side scripts from reading the cookie which mitigates XSS
    attacks. Set the 'HttpOnly' flag by setting 'HttpOnly' to 'true'
    in the Options struct.
