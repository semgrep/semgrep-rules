      The Origin header in the HTTP WebSocket handshake is used to guarantee that the
      connection accepted by the WebSocket is from a trusted origin domain. Failure to enforce can
      lead to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). As per "gorilla/websocket" documentation: "A CheckOrigin 
      function should carefully validate the request origin to prevent cross-site request forgery."
