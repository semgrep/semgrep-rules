  message: |
    Detected a potentially dynamic ClientTrace. This occurred because semgrep could not
    find a static definition for '$TRACE'. Dynamic ClientTraces are dangerous because
    they deserialize function code to run when certain Request events occur, which could lead
    to code being run without your knowledge. Ensure that your ClientTrace is statically defined.
  metadata:
    cwe: 'CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources'
    owasp: 'A8: Insecure Deserialization'

  # Detects when a static ClientTrace is not defined in the same file as
  # WithClientTrace. Not a perfect detection, but sufficiently works in a
  # scan of ~1k repos: https://dev.massive.ret2.co/triager/filter/1007
