  message: |
    Detected template variable interpolation in a JavaScript
    template string. This is potentially vulnerable to 
    cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because a malicious
    actor has control over JavaScript but without the need 
    to use escaped characters. Instead, obtain this variable
    outside of the template string and ensure your template
    is properly escaped.
