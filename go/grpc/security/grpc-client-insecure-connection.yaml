  message: >-
    Found an insecure gRPC connection using 'grpc.WithInsecure()'. This creates a connection without encryption to a gRPC
    server. A malicious attacker could tamper with the gRPC message, which could compromise the machine. Instead, establish
    a secure connection with an
    SSL certificate using the 'grpc.WithTransportCredentials()' function. You can create a create credentials using a 'tls.Config{}'
    struct with 'credentials.NewTLS()'. The final fix looks like this: 'grpc.WithTransportCredentials(credentials.NewTLS(<config>))'.
