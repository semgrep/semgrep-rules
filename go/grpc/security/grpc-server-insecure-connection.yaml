  message: >-
    Found an insecure gRPC server without 'grpc.Creds()'. This allows for a connection without encryption to this server.
    A malicious attacker could tamper with the gRPC message, which could compromise the machine. Include credentials derived
    from an SSL certificate in order to create a secure gRPC connection. You can create credentials using 'credentials.NewServerTLSFromFile("cert.pem",
    "cert.key")'.
