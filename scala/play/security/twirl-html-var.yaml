    Raw html content controlled by a variable detected. You may be accidentally bypassing secure methods
    of rendering HTML by manually constructing HTML and this could create a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could
    let attackers steal sensitive user data. Try to avoid using `Html()` or consider properly sanitizing input data.
