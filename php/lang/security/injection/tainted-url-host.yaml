  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    User data flows into the host portion of this manually-constructed URL. This could allow an attacker to send data
    to their own server, potentially exposing sensitive data such as cookies or authorization information sent with this request.
    They could also probe internal servers or other resources that the server runnig this code can access. (This is called
    server-side request forgery, or SSRF.) Do not allow arbitrary hosts. Instead, create an allowlist for approved hosts hardcode
    the correct host.
