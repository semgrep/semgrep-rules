  message: |
    Detected possible DOM-based XSS. This occurs because a portion of the URL is being used
    to construct an element added directly to the page. For example, a malicious actor could
    send someone a link like this: http://www.some.site/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    which would add the script to the page.
    Consider allowlisting appropriate values or using an approach which does not involve the URL.
