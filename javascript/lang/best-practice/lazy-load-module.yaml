      Lazy loading can complicate code bundling if care is not taken, also `require`s
      are run synchronously by Node.js.
      If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being
      handled at a more critical time.
      The best practice is to `require` modules at the beginning of each file, before
      and outside of any functions.
