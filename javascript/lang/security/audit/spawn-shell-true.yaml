  message: |
    Found '$SPAWN' with '{shell: $SHELL}'. This is dangerous because this call will spawn
    the command using a shell process. Doing so propagates current shell settings and variables, which
    makes it much easier for a malicious actor to execute commands. Use '{shell: false}' instead.
