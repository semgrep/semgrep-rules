  message: |
    The Mustache escape function is being overwritten. This could bypass
    HTML escaping safety measures built into the rendering engine, exposing
    your application to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If you
    need unescaped HTML, use the triple brace operator in your template:
    '{{{ ... }}}'.
