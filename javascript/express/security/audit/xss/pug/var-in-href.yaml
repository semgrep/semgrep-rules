  message: |
    Detected a template variable used in an anchor tag with
    the 'href' attribute. This allows a malicious actor to
    input the 'javascript:' URI and is subject to cross-
    site scripting (XSS) attacks. If using a relative URL,
    start with a literal forward slash and concatenate the URL,
    like this: a(href='/'+url). You may also consider setting
    the Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
