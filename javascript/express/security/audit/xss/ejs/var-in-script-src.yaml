  message: >-
    Detected a template variable used as the 'src' in a script tag.
    Although template variables are HTML escaped, HTML
    escaping does not always prevent malicious URLs from being injected
    and could results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    Prefer not to dynamically generate the 'src' attribute and use static
    URLs instead. If you must do this, carefully check URLs against an
    allowlist and be sure to URL-encode the result.
