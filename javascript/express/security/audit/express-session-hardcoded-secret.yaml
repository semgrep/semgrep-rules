    message: >- 
      A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended 
      to store credentials in source-code, as this risks secrets
      being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. 
      It is recommended to use environment variables to 
      securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials from 
      a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
