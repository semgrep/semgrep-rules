id: express-session-hardcoded-secret
message: >- 
      The "secret" attribute of the express-session third-party package is used to sign session IDs. The secret was found to be hard-coded, which can lead to session hijacking attacks if uncovered by a malicious actor. 
      It is recommended to rotate the compromised secret and use either environment variables or a secure storage mechanism to retrieve the secret. 
      It is also recommended to periodically rotate the secret based on your organization's best practices.
