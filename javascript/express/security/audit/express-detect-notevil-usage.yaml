    message:
      Detected usage of the `notevil` package, which is unmaintained and has vulnerabilities.
      Using any sort of `eval()` functionality can be very dangerous, but if you must,
      the `eval` package is an up to date alternative. Be sure that only trusted input
      reaches an `eval()` function.
