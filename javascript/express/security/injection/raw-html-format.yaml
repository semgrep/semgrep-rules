    User data flows into the host portion of this manually-constructed URL.
    This could allow an attacker to send data to their own server, potentially
    exposing sensitive data such as cookies or authorization information sent
    with this request. They could also probe internal servers or other resources
    that the server runnig this code can access. (This is called server-side request
    forgery, or SSRF.) Do not allow arbitrary hosts. Instead, create an allowlist
    for approved hosts hardcode the correct host.
