  severity: WARNING
  message: >-
    Detected SQL statement that is tainted by `$EVENT` object. This could lead to SQL injection if the variable is user-controlled
    and not properly sanitized. In order to prevent SQL injection,
    used parameterized queries or prepared statements instead.
    You can use parameterized statements like so:
    `sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = ?', { replacements: ['active'], type: QueryTypes.SELECT });`
