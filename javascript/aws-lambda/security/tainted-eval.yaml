  message: >-
    The `eval()` function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
    Executing JavaScript from a string is an enormous security risk.
    It is far too easy for a bad actor to run arbitrary code when you use `eval()`.
    Ensure evaluated content is not definable by external sources.
