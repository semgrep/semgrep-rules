  message: >
    Set "rejectUnauthorized" to false is a convenient way to resolve
    certificate error. But this method is unsafe because it disables
    the server certificate verification, making the Node app open to
    MITM attack.
    "rejectUnauthorized" option must be alway set to True (default value).
    With self -signed certificat or custom CA, use "ca" option to define
    Root Certicate.
    This rule checks TLS configuration only for Postgresql, MariaDB and
    MySQL. SQLite is not really concerned by TLS configuration.
    This rule could be extended for MSSQL, but the dialectOptions
    is specific for Tedious.
