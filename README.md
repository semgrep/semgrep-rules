Welcome! This repository is the standard library for [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) rules. There are many more rules available in the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) written by [r2c](https://r2c.dev/) and other contributors. The [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) includes rules from this repository and additional rules that are accessible with the Team or Enterprise tiers of [Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/pricing). If there is a specific rule you are looking for, see the [Semgrep registry search](https://semgrep.dev/r). To contribute, find details about contributing in the [Contributing to Semgrep rules](https://semgrep.dev/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/) documentation.

## Using Semgrep rules repository

Run existing and custom Semgrep rules locally with the Semgrep command line interface (Semgrep CLI) or continuously with Semgrep in CI while using Semgrep App. To start using Semgrep rules, see [Semgrep tutorial](https://semgrep.dev/learn), [Getting started with Semgrep CLI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/), and [Getting started with Semgrep App](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/).
