## Running Rules in CI/Pre-Commit/Developer Workflow

If you want run these rules rather than write them, check out the easy-to-use [bento.dev](https://bento.dev)

## Testing Rules

A testing system is available which can be used to check the rules against example source code files. It requires `semgrep` from [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev)

If you wrote a rule in a yaml named `eqeq-bad.yaml` with a rule id named `my-eqeq-bad`, you could put a file in the same directory named eqeq-bad.py (it just needs to have the same name except for the extension as eqeq-bad.yaml). Then:

```python
# ruleid:my-eqeq-bad
x == x
```

Running `make test` will execute the test suite, and if `my-eqeq-bad` does not fire on the line below the comment, your rule will fail.

If you have a rule that is not working, but you want to commit it soo it's documented but not fail the tests, use `#todoruleid:...`:

```python
# todoruleid:my-eqeq-bad
x != x
```

### Github Action To Run Tests

If you fork this repo or create your own, you can add a special [semgrep-rules-test](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/semgrep-rules-test) Github Action to your workflow that will automatically test your rules by running `make test` using the latest version of semgrep.

See ours [here](.github/workflows/semgrep-rules-test.yml)
