Welcome! This repository is the standard library for open source [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) rules.

In addition to the rules in this repository, the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) offers proprietary [Pro rules](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code/pro-rules) that enable interfile and interprocedural analysis.

- Find rules: search for open source and Pro rules through the [Semgrep registry search](https://semgrep.dev/r).
- Use rules: Scan your code with these rules through [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login)
- Contribute to rules: see [Contributing to Semgrep rules](https://semgrep.dev/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository/) for more information.

## Using the Semgrep rules repository

To start writing and using Semgrep rules, see [Learn Semgrep syntax](https://semgrep.dev/learn) and [Writing rules](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/overview/). Then, run existing and custom Semgrep rules locally with the [Semgrep command line interface (Semgrep CLI)](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) or [continuously with Semgrep in CI while using Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-app/getting-started-with-semgrep-app/).

## Writing Semgrep rules

See [Writing rules](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/overview/) for information including:

- Pattern syntax, describing what Semgrep patterns can do in detail, and example use cases of the ellipsis operator, metavariables.
- Rule syntax, describing Semgrep YAML rule files, which can have multiple patterns, detailed output messages, and autofixes. The syntax allows the composition of individual patterns with boolean operators.

You can also learn how to write rules using the [interactive, example-based Semgrep rule tutorial](https://semgrep.dev/learn).
